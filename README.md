# Sales_Analysis

This project aims to analyze sales data recorded over a year, with individual sales files for each month. The analysis will provide insights into sales performance, identify trends and patterns. In this project we use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze the data.

Key points :
- Data source: Individual monthly sales files spanning a year.
- Objective: Analyze sales performance over time.
- Scope: Identify trends, patterns, and potential areas for improvement.
- Deliverables: Comprehensive report with insights and recommendations.

Steps Involved :
- We start by Cleaning our data, by dropping NaN values, removing empty rows and columns and changing the Data types.
- After the cleaning, we move to the Data exploration part which answers few question like:
  - What's the best month for sales?
  - Which city sold the most?
  - What products are sold most often?
  - What's the best time in the day most of the customers are purchasing the items?
  - Why few products are sold the most?
- We do all this by following different Pandas & Matplotlib methods:
  - Concatinating multiple files
  - Adding new columns
  - Using .apply(), groupby
  - Plotting bar chart and line graphs to visualize the results
